* bf: A Brainf*** interpreter written in C
This is my Brainf*** interpreter written in C. The array is only 1024 bytes
long. Right now it only implements the 6 characters: ~>~, ~<~, ~+~, ~-~, ~.~,
and ~,~ since I haven't been able to handle the loop characters ~[~ and ~]~
well, but hopefully in the future I will fix that. In addition, it does not
handle the pointer moving outsite the array, so it can crash if your Brainf***
program is not well written.
** How to compile and run
#+begin_src shell
make
./bf FILE
#+end_src
where FILE is the name of a Brainf*** program.
