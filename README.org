* bf: A Brainf*** interpreter written in C
This is my Brainf*** interpreter written in C. The array is only 1024 bytes
long. Right now it implements all of the characters of the language, but the
loop characters ~[~ and ~]~ work somewhat unpredictably: not all Brainf***
programs work properly, but most of them do.
** How to compile and run
#+begin_src shell
make
./bf FILE
#+end_src
where FILE is the name of a Brainf*** program.
